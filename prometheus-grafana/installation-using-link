Exporters configuration
-----------------------

Access prometheus.io

In the search box, serach for blackbox_exporter 

copy the link to the linux package

user wget to download

  wget https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/releases/download/v0.26.0/blackbox_exporter-0.26.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Extract the package after downloading
Delete the tar file
Rename the extracted file to blackbox_exporter

   cd blackbox_exporter
   ls
Execute the blackbox_exporter executable file to start blackbox

    ./blackbox_exporter &

Access blackbox_exporter

     public-ip:9115  


cd to prometheus
vi prometheus.yml

Define the application url that you want to monitor and the blackbox_exporter public-ip:9115.
Edit the below file with your application url and blackbox_exporter public-ip:9115

https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter

  - job_name: 'blackbox'
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module: [http_2xx]  # Look for a HTTP 200 response.
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - http://prometheus.io    # Target to probe with http.
        - http://example.com:8080 # Target to probe with http on port 8080.
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115  # The blackbox exporter's real hostname:port.
  
After doing that, run the below command to get the prometheus process id;

       pgrep prometheus

copy the prometheus PID and kill the process

       kill PID

 This is because we have to restart prometheus
 
        ./prometheus &    -> to restart  


Lonin to grafana, import a dashbord and monitor the application.

Jenkins monitoring
------------------

Install node_exporter in jenkins.

Access prometheus.io
Search for node_exporter

Copy the link and download it in jenkins using wget.

     wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.9.0/node_exporter-1.9.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

After downloading it, unzip the file.
Rename the extracted file to node_exporter.
Delete the tar file

cd node_exporter
ls
Run the executable file

    ./node_exporter

Access node_exporter

     public-ip:9100    

Connect to prometheus server
cd prometheus
ls
vi prometheus.yml

Define node_exporter and jenkins

  - job_name: "node-exporter"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['34.207.165.62:9100']

  - job_name: "jenkins"
    metrics_path: /prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['34.207.165.62:8080']

Copy the process ID and kill the process

     kill PID

Restart prometheus

    ./prometheus &     

Verify on prometheus GUI to make sure all the nodes are up and running

Create a new Dashboard for node exporter to monitor jenkins
